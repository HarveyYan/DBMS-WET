Current status: 

with correct username and password, the csl2 account is working fine. No problem occurs when logging onto csl2 or using PostgreSQL Library.




Progress so far: 

Have created basic structure of wet.c, which includes a main function “int main(int attic, char* argv[]);” to log into csl2 account and connect to PostgreSQL database with a handler “PGconn* conn”, as explained in the HW2.pdf; after that, the main function wills start parsing commands using “void parseInput();” which is already provided and implemented “in parser.c”.

Rest of the work in wet.c is to implement 12 different functions catered for the 12 separate sql/ddl/dml commands, which have already been declared in wet.h.

In every function, the result from doing sql query will be contained in a variable “res”, of “PGresult*” type; The PGLIB has provided various way to parse into that data structure to get specified values. Then those values will be printed to STDOUT using constants already defined in wet.h

Till now “void* addUser(const char* name);” and “void* addUserMin(const char* name);” have already been implemented and tested on csl2 server. The team will divide the workload in a equitable manner.
